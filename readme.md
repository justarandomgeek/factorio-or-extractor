Adds keybinds for modified copy-paste behavior for Decider Combinators:

* **Append Conditions** (Alt + Shift + Left Click) will paste the copied conditions as a new "or" group in the target combinator (outputs untouched)
* **Split Conditions** (Alt + Shift + Right Click) will split a decider into a blueprint of one decider per "or" group
